# Sense Embeddings for Memory Efficient Large Language Models

Welcome to the repository for our paper, **Sense Embeddings for Memory Efficient Large Language Models**. This repository contains the implementation code for three tasks discussed in the paper: **Word Similarity Task**, **LLM Replacement Test** ,and **Knowledge Distillation**.

## Repository Structure

- **`./WordSimilarityTask/`**: Contains the code and resources related to the **Word Similarity Task**.

- **`./KnowledgeDistillation/`**: Contains the code for the **LLM Replacement Test** and **Knowledge Distillation**.

Note: To maintain the integrity of the double-blind experiment, we have not included any identifying information in our code. The contact information provided in the code belongs to the DeBERTa authors, whose work we utilized in our research.
